I chose a dataset that surveyed a little over 1000 young people on their hobbies, fears, and personal opinions.
I wanted to see whether I could predict loneliness based on these factors. 

The data was fairly easy to work with as everything was on a scale of 1-5, with 5 representing 'highly agree' with survey question.
For an explanation of the survey questions, you can refer to the [<span style="font-size:12pt;">description</span>](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey?select=columns.csv) on Kaggle.

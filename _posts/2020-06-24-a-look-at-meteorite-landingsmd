I took a look at NASA'S Meteorite Landings dataset. This set contains information about all recorded meteorite landings on Earth between the years 601 and 2013. I wanted to see if I could find anything interesting about the mass, location, and frequency of meteorites.

I wondered if there was a significant difference in mass between the meteorites that were observed falling from the sky, and those that were found on the ground. 
First, I took a general look at how many were found per year
meteor['year'].value_counts().sort_index(ascending=False).plot(figsize=(20,5), title='Recorded Meteorite Findings');
